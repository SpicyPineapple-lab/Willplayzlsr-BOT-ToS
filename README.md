1. Introduction
Welcome to Willplayzlsr BOT (“the Bot”). By using the Bot, you agree to comply with and be bound by these Terms of Service (“ToS”).

2. Bot Features
The Bot offers an economy system where users can earn coins, buy customizations such as backgrounds and name colors, participate in gambling games, and manage a bank system with interest. These features are provided "as is" and may change or be updated without notice.

3. User Responsibility
You are responsible for any actions taken with your account, including managing your coins and customizations.

The Bot does not guarantee any monetary value for the coins or items earned in the Bot. Coins and items are for entertainment purposes only.

4. Data Collection

Data is stored securely but may be lost if the Bot is offline or data files are deleted.

The Bot includes a gambling feature (coin flip game) where users can bet coins and may win or lose.

By using the gambling feature, you acknowledge it is for fun and no real money is involved or guaranteed.

6. Bank System
The bank feature allows users to deposit coins and earn interest over real days.

Withdrawals may be delayed 1-2 real days to simulate banking restrictions.

Interest rates and rules may be updated without notice.

Server administrators have commands to add or remove coins from users at their discretion.

Users trust server admins to manage balances fairly.

8. Limitation of Liability
The Bot and its creator are not liable for any losses, damages, or issues arising from the use of the Bot.

Use the Bot at your own risk.

9. Changes to Terms
